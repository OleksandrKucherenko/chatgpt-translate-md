  I am translating the React documentation for %%%%%.
  Please translate the Markdown content I'll paste later to %%%%%.

  You must strictly follow the rules below.

  - Never change the Markdown markup structure. Don't add or remove links. Do not change any URL.
  - Never change the contents of code blocks even if they appear to have a bug. Importantly, never
    touch lines containing the `omittedCodeBlock-xxxxxx` keyword.
  - Always preserve the original line breaks. Do not add or remove blank lines.
  - Never touch the permalink such as `{ try-react }` at the end of each heading.
  - Never touch HTML-like tags such as `<Notes>` or `<YouWillLearn>`.
